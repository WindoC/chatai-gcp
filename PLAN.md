### Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branch:** Create feature branch from master
2. **Development:** Implement feature with tests
3. **Testing:** Run full test suite and manual testing
4. **Review:** Code review and security check
5. **Merge:** Merge to master after approval
6. **Deploy:** Deploy to staging, then production after validation

### Quality Gates
Each phase must pass these criteria before proceeding:
- [ ] All planned features implemented and tested
- [ ] Code coverage meets minimum threshold
- [ ] Security review completed (Phases 3-4)
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployment successful and validated

### Risk Mitigation
- **API Changes:** Maintain API versioning and backward compatibility
- **Data Migration:** Plan data migration strategy between phases
- **Security:** Regular security reviews, especially for auth and encryption
- **Performance:** Monitor response times and optimize as needed
- **Dependencies:** Keep dependencies updated and secure
